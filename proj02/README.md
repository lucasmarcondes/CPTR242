# CPTR 242: Project #2

## Problem Overview
Your task in this project is to design and implement village housing waiting list.

You must collect enough information about each applicatioin to support the priority waitlist.
Priority is granted to applicants who are married and/or have children and/or are 25 years of age or older.
Housing offers are made to other applicants on a first-come, first-served basis. 

## Solution Specifications

Your solution to this problem must meet the following criteria.

1. Provide a clean UI managing applications.
2. Collect appliation information to allow contacting the individual and determine appliaction priority.
3. Provide a list showing the current waiting list.
4. Option to assign the next application based on priority.
5. A set of tests which provide full test coverage of all list functions. 


## Project Phases

The project is broken up into several phases to completed in order.

### Data Structure Evaluation

The first phase is to evaluate possible data structures for the project.
Write up a list of possible data structures (minimum of three).
Detail the stregthns and weaknesses of these data structures for this application.
Include in the anaylsis a comparision of Big-O notation of data structure functions.

### Writing Tests

Before coding, write up a set of tests that can be used to ensure the data structure is implemented correctly.
These test will be converted to C++ tests which you will implement as part of the project.
The tests should attempt to get 100% code coverage of your data structure.
The tests do not need to include the user input and output.
Just the internal classes.

### Implementation

### Write Up

Write up your experience in implementing your data structure.
