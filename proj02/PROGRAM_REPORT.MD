## Program Report

#### Run Instructions:
- Load all files to your local IDE
- Build and Run

#### Writing Tests Before Application: 

- This is a good idea for brainstorming/planning how the data structure will work 
and process correctly. 
- For this project, I had conflicts with actually writing the tests before the application
 because I practically made up functions and classes that I would then replace with real
 ones later on, when I could have just written the correct ones from the start.


#### Conclusion:
* Considering my very little exposure to programming, I feel like I was put to a disadvantage
 throughout this project. Working on a project this big pushes me to work on my programming 
  organization.
* Figuring out how to use CMake was one of the biggest challenges.
