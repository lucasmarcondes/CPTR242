# Test Report
For this project, I will be implementing a system of queues to determine the priority for Village Housing. Different priority members will be assigned to different lists, where the program will output the correct order of applicants.

### Queue Length 
* Tests the length of the list in comparison to how many were added to verify that it works correctly.

### Queue Order
* Checks that applicants are in the correct order in terms of priority.

### Queue Deletion
* Confirms that elements on the queue are deleted correctly.

### Queue Assignment
* This test will check if the applicant is assigned to the correct queue based off of their status (married, age 25, or not of the two).
